**Analysis Phase**: 4 of 4 - Use Case Extraction

---

## Overview

This document contains the results of Phase 4 analysis: extracting use cases from the
identified actors, system boundaries, and business processes.

The Reverse Engineer system involves 0 identified actors
interacting through 0 use cases across
0 system boundaries.

*Note: For detailed actor information, see phase2-actors.md. For system boundary details, see phase3-boundaries.md.*

## Completion Summary

All 4 phases of reverse engineering analysis are now complete:

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Project Structure Analysis
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Actor Discovery
- ✅ **Phase 3**: System Boundary Mapping  
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Use Case Extraction

### Generated Documentation

The complete analysis has produced:
- `phase1-structure.md` - Project structure and components
- `phase2-actors.md` - Actor identification and roles
- `phase3-boundaries.md` - System boundaries and architecture
- `phase4-use-cases.md` - Use cases and business processes

### Next Steps

1. **Review and Refine**: Examine all generated documents for accuracy
2. **Consolidate**: Create unified documentation if needed
3. **Maintain**: Update as the codebase evolves
