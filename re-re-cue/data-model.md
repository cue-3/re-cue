## Model Relationships

The model relationships are determined by examining `@DBRef`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`,
and other relationship annotations in the source code. Refer to the individual model

implementations. Common patterns include:

1. **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for entity management

3. **Persistence**: JPA/MongoDB annotations handle database mapping
4. **Business Logic**: Service classes orchestrate model interactions
