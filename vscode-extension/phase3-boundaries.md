## System Boundaries

| System Boundary | Type | Component Count | Key Components |
|-----------------|------|-----------------|----------------|
*No system boundaries discovered*

---

## Subsystem Architecture

| Subsystem | Components | Interfaces | Component List |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------------|
*No subsystems identified*

---

## Layer Organization

*No layers identified*

---

## Component Mapping

*Not yet implemented*

---

## Boundary Interactions

## Next Steps

After reviewing the boundary mapping:

1. **Proceed to Phase 4**: Use Case Extraction
   - Identify use cases from actor-boundary interactions
   - Extract business processes
   - Document scenarios and workflows

2. **Command to continue**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m reverse_engineer --phase 4 --path /Users/squick/workspace/cue-3/re-cue/vscode-extension
   ```
