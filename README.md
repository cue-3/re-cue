# RE-cue

*Cue your software RE-development journey*

RE-cue will assist in reverse engineering software products based on source code evaluation. RE-cue was born out of dealing with the complexities of "brownfield" development. Software development is hardest when you enter an existing project and are asked to maintain or improve a project that you are inheriting in an unknown state. That is where RE-cue comes in. RE-cue will review an existing code base and generate architectural documentation for code owners.

- **Implementation Plans** (plan.md) - Technical analysis and architectural documentation
- **Data Model Documentation** (data-model.md) - Comprehensive data structure analysis
- **API Contracts** (api-spec.json) - OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for existing endpoints
- **Use Case Analysis** (use-cases.md) - ✨ **NEW** Actor identification, system boundaries, and business process documentation with transaction/validation/workflow analysis
- **Interactive Use Case Refinement** - ✨ **NEW** Edit and improve generated use cases through an interactive text-based interface

**Primary Use Cases:**
- � **Legacy System Documentation** - Generate comprehensive docs for undocumented codebases
- 🔄 **Brownfield Project Onboarding** - Help new team members understand inherited projects
- 📋 **Code Modernization** - Create foundation documentation for refactoring efforts
- � **System Analysis** - Understand complex codebases through automated analysis

## Why Use RE-cue?

🎯 **Automated Documentation** - Transform source code into readable specifications  
📋 **Standardized Output** - Consistent documentation formats across projects  
🚀 **Rapid Understanding** - Quickly grasp complex legacy systems  
📊 **Multiple Formats** - Generate various documentation types from single analysis  
📝 **Business-Friendly** - Creates documentation accessible to technical and non-technical stakeholders  
✨ **Business Context Analysis** - Extracts transaction boundaries, validation rules, and workflow patterns from Spring Boot annotations

## ✨ NEW: Use Case Analysis Feature

The Python version now includes comprehensive use case analysis that automatically:

### 🎯 **Actor Identification**
- Discovers system actors from security annotations (`@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`)
- Maps roles to system boundaries (Admin Console, Customer Portal, API)
- Identifies external systems and third-party integrations

### 🏗️ **Business Process Detection**
- **Transaction Analysis**: Extracts `@Transactional` boundaries with propagation and isolation levels
- **Validation Rules**: Parses Jakarta/Hibernate validation annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, `@Pattern`, etc.)
- **Workflow Patterns**: Identifies async operations (`@Async`), scheduled tasks (`@Scheduled`), and retry logic (`@Retryable`)

### 📋 **Enhanced Use Case Documentation**
Generates use-cases.md with:
- **Preconditions**: Derived from transaction and validation requirements
- **Postconditions**: Based on transaction commits and workflow completions
- **Extension Scenarios**: Realistic failure cases from validation rules and workflow patterns
- **Business Context Metrics**: Transaction boundaries, validation rules, workflow patterns, derived business rules

### 📊 **Example Output**

```markdown
## UC-001: Create Order

**Primary Actor**: Customer  
**System Boundary**: Customer Portal  
**Goal**: Submit a new product order

### Business Context
- **Transaction Boundaries**: 3
- **Validation Rules**: 8
- **Workflow Patterns**: 2
- **Business Rules**: 12

### Preconditions
- User must be authenticated with CUSTOMER role
- Shopping cart must not be empty
- Payment information must be valid (validated: card number format, expiration date)
- Shipping address must be complete (validated: required fields, postal code format)

### Main Success Scenario
1. Customer reviews items in cart
2. System validates cart contents and pricing
3. Customer enters payment information
4. System processes payment asynchronously
5. System creates order (REQUIRES_NEW transaction)
6. System sends confirmation email

### Postconditions
- Order record committed to database
- Payment transaction completed
- Confirmation email queued for delivery
- Inventory updated

### Extensions
- **2a**: Cart contains out-of-stock items → System notifies customer and removes unavailable items
- **3a**: Payment card fails validation → System displays field-level errors
- **4a**: Payment processing times out → System retries with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- **5a**: Order creation fails → System rolls back transaction and notifies customer
```

### 🔧 **Usage**

Generate use case documentation:
```bash
# Python version (recommended for use cases)
python3 -m reverse_engineer --use-cases ~/projects/my-spring-app

# With verbose output
python3 -m reverse_engineer --use-cases --verbose ~/projects/my-spring-app

# Phased analysis (resumable)
python3 -m reverse_engineer --use-cases --phased ~/projects/my-spring-app

# Interactively refine generated use cases
python3 -m reverse_engineer --refine-use-cases re-my-spring-app/phase4-use-cases.md
```
