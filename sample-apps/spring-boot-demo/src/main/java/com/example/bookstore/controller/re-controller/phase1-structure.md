## Next Steps

After reviewing this structure analysis:

1. **Proceed to Phase 2**: Actor Discovery
   - Identify users, roles, and external systems
   - Map security annotations to actors
   - Determine access levels

2. **Command to continue**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m reverse_engineer --phase 2 --path /Users/squick/workspace/cue-3/re-cue/sample-apps/spring-boot-demo/src/main/java/com/example/bookstore/controller
   ```
