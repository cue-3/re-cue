## Next Steps

After reviewing the actor analysis:

1. **Proceed to Phase 3**: System Boundary Mapping
   - Map actors to system boundaries

   - Define component interactions

2. **Command to continue**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m reverse_engineer --phase 3 --path /Users/squick/workspace/cue-3/re-cue/sample-apps/spring-boot-demo
   ```
